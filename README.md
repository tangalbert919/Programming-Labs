# Programming Labs

Welcome to my new repository for all of my labs, which are written in various programming languages. Here, you can learn how to code and what each lab does from the documentation I made. Whatever programming language you want to learn, there will be a section for it (and if there isn't, just tell me and I will add it as soon as I can).

It doesn't matter if you are learning this for fun, or if programming will become your life. I am just making these labs, in hopes that people are able to learn stuff from them. I make these labs when I have the time to do it.

If you're a first-time programmer, it is recommended that you learn Python or Java first. Those are the easiest languages you can learn (in my opinion) mostly because it's not complex (which is a fact). When you feel like you can do this, then you'll be ready for more complex languages like C or C++. I am not trying to influence your decisions, and I don't know how your brain works, so take what I said as advice.

If you want to be a web developer, learning HTML and CSS is required because HTML is for the website itself and CSS adds style to the website. You can learn this from [W3Schools](http://w3schools.com) or from here once I get that section up and running.

### Issues
------------------------------------------
If you found any issues within these labs, please [create an issue ticket here](https://github.com/tangalbert919/Programming-Labs/issues/new/).

Your ticket will not be accepted if:
* This is an issue already resolved a long time ago.
* This is NOT relevant to programming whatsoever.

### Guidelines for pull requests
------------------------------------------
When uploading new labs or adding new programming languages to the project, please make sure you follow these guidelines before making a pull request:

* Absolutely NO copyrighted libraries (unless the license for it allows distribution).
* The labs must be documented. It can be in the code, or a text document. Power Points and Word Documents are also accepted.
* You may NOT have labs that are obscene or create obscene stuff when run. That means anything regarding stuff that people under the 18 cannot view is strictly prohibited.

I will review your pull requests before I decide on whether or not I can merge your work.

### Integrated Development Environments (IDE)
------------------------------------------
IDEs are basically like text editors, except they are dedicated to programming. Whatever IDE you download is dedicated to one or more languages, and are covered in the README.md files in the sections already made.

If you are the kind of person who would rather code with a text editor, you can stick to the one you have, or use [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/). By doing this, you would be considered a hardcore programmer, but that means a lot MORE work.

Thanks for reading this, and have fun learning how to code.
