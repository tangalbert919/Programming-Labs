# Programming Labs

Welcome to my repository for all of my labs, which are written in various programming languages. Here, you can learn how to code and what each lab does from the documentation I made. Whatever programming language you want to learn, there will be a section for it (and if there isn't, just tell me and I will add it as soon as I can).

It doesn't matter if you are learning this for fun, or if programming will become your life. I am just making these labs, in hopes that people are able to learn stuff from them. I make these labs when I have the time to do it.

This is not an alternative to reading a book on learning a programming language, nor is it an excuse to not take a class in Computer Science. This is just for users to learn some code, and possibly gain some skill from it.

### Issues
------------------------------------------
If you found any issues within these labs, please [create an issue ticket here](https://github.com/tangalbert919/Programming-Labs/issues/new/).

Your ticket will not be accepted if:
* This is an issue already resolved a long time ago.
* This is NOT relevant to programming whatsoever.
* This is a duplicate ticket.

### Guidelines for pull requests
------------------------------------------
When uploading new labs or adding new programming languages to the project, please make sure you follow these guidelines before making a pull request:

* Absolutely NO copyrighted libraries (unless the license for it allows distribution).
* The labs must be documented. It can be in the code, or a text document. Power Points and Word Documents are also accepted.
* You may NOT have labs that either make or contain obscene material. There may be programmers under the age of 18 wanting to learn this, and I don't want to get arrested over something like that.

I will review your pull requests before I decide on whether or not I can merge your work.

### Requirements for programming
------------------------------------------
If you're going to do any kind of programming, you need the following:

* A computer (obviously). A good rule of thumb is no computer that falls under the $300 price tag will be sufficient for programming. You will need one with a lot of space (and have an SSD, if you have the money to spare), a decent CPU (Intel Core i5 or AMD A-Series is strong enough), and a decent GPU if you're going to be doing some work with graphics (NVIDIA GeForce GTX or AMD Radeon R-Series).

* Either a text editor or an IDE. An IDE is short for "Integrated Development Environment", which are dedicated to specific programming languages, and have useful features to make you more productive. If you're just starting out, and are not sure about entering the programming field, start with a text editor (such as Notepad), and switch to an IDE later if you decide to dedicate yourself to that field.

* Your brain. You're going to be learning stuff, and there is no excuse for not using your brain.

I hope you have a good time learning how to program.
