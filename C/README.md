# C Labs
--------------
This is a set of C Labs that I made. I'm teaching myself this language by using books and online resources (but the reliability for both is undetermined). The more famous C++ is based off of C, and it's a good idea to understand and be able to program in C before learning how to program in C++.

C is known best for low level memory management and having a bunch of built-in libraries to aid you in better handling of memory and hardware. Its efficiency is why kernels are written in C (like the famous [Linux kernel](https://github.com/torvalds/linux)), but it gets that efficiency by requiring you to perform low-level memory management by hand. The machine will be more efficient, but makes us humans less productive.

If you learn C++ first, it's not difficult to learn C, and vice versa. However, you are more productive the more you avoid programming in C (because we want to use our time efficiently, and C does not let you do that).

### Requirements
----------------
For Windows users (which is about 85% of PC users), you need to install a C compiler. If you're compiling from the command line, you need to install Cygwin, and the instructions are [here](http://preshing.com/20141108/how-to-install-the-latest-gcc-on-windows/). If you're using an IDE, this isn't required (in theory, but every IDE is different).

For Mac users, you already have a compiler, and it's called "Clang". You just need an IDE to use it.

For Linux users, you have a bunch of compilers ready for use (GCC and G++). You can either use it from the Terminal or by using an IDE.

### IDEs for C
----------------
* [CLion](http://www.jetbrains.com/clion/) is a powerful and feature-rich IDE developed by [JetBrains](http://www.jetbrains.com/). You can learn more about it on their website.

* [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org) is a powerful IDE that supports many programming languages, but you need to install the [Oracle JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/index.html) in order to use it.

* Xcode is an IDE developed by Apple, and only works on macOS. It can only be found in the Mac App Store. [AppCode](http://www.jetbrains.com/objc/) is a smart IDE developed by [JetBrains](http://www.jetbrains.com), but requires Xcode for it to work.

* [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/) is an IDE developed by Microsoft, and only works on Windows (but has a preview version for Mac users). You can learn more about it on their website.
