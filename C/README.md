# C Labs
--------------
This is a programming language I'm learning for 2 reasons:

1. It's a very useful language, especially if you're learning how to become a hacker (please be a white hat or gray hat because black hats have to constantly hide).

2. It's probably the only language out there that is responsible for memory management, and is not object-oriented. C++ and Objective-C are based on C, with the latter being a strict superset, but both have a layer of object-orientation.

This, I will learn from a book and online, so expect one lab every week or so.

### Background Information About C
--------------
C is mostly used in kernels (which are used to load entire operating systems and do some memory management), but is also used as a replacement to assembly code, and to make programs (like text editors and network drivers). Some people say it's not popular anymore, up to the point where C is dead. That's actually not true, and chances are people say that because C is complex, and we live in the world where we like everything to be simple, which is why Swift is on the rise (and I mean the programming language called Swift by Apple, not the artist named "Taylor Swift", in case you're wondering).

C is a difficult language to learn, so it's best to have prior programming knowledge in other languages first before learning this one, mostly so you can rip your hair out, trying to understand basic syntax.

The worst part about C is how efficient it is. For machines, it runs quickly, but for the typical human, C will mess up your time management, because you're trying to make the program written in C be fast for the machine. That's why hackers and programmers say the less time you spend programming in C, the more efficient you are.
