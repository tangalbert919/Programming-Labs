# Objective-C Labs
--------------------
These labs are coming soon.

### Background
--------------------
Objective-C is a superset of C, meaning any C program you make is also an Objective-C program. It was inspired by 2 guys working at a company who wanted to implement the features from another language called Smalltalk, and maintain backwards compatibility with C. Hence, Objective-C.

Objective-C is an object-oriented language, and usually, Apple developers learn this language or Swift so they can make applications for Apple devices. Objective-C++ is basically C++ and Objective-C mixed together, but that's for another day.

This language is actually more COMPLEX than C and C++, which means it's harder to learn. You'll see it in the first few labs when they're released.

### IDEs
--------------------
So far, the only IDE I know that can do Objective-C is Xcode, but there are many text editors out there that can help you write it.
