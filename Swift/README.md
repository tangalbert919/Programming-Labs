# Swift Labs
---------------
COMING SOON!!!

### Background 
---------------
Swift is an [open source](https://github.com/apple/swift) programming language made by Apple, and has been in development for years. Recently, more and more developers are learning Swift to develop applications for Apple, thanks to its simplicity and friendliness to new developers.

It is usually recommended to learn Swift before learning Objective-C, which is a more complex, cruel, and downright painful variant of C.

### IDEs
---------------
While Xcode is the only official IDE to use Swift natively, you can only use Xcode on a macOS system (a virtual machine with macOS will work). CLion offers a plugin that allows Swift development.
