# Swift Labs
---------------
COMING SOON!!!

### Background 
---------------
Swift is an [open source](https://github.com/apple/swift) programming language made by Apple, and has been in development for years. Apple developers typically learn this language to make iOS applications, and to many beginners, this is a good place to start if you want to start making your own applications for Apple.

Swift is less complex than Objective-C, which is why some programmers typically learn this first. By learning Swift, it might become easier to learn Objective-C later on.

### IDEs
---------------
The only IDE that's known to work is Xcode, which is only available in the Mac App Store.
