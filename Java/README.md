# Java Labs
-------------------
This is the set of Java Labs I've made. Because I'm a student in computer science (and I mean high school computer science), you will most likely see this as school projects that I had to do in order to pass. I made good grades from them because I got the programs to work properly.

I am constantly adding more labs to this as I continue to learn more Java. There might be some challenges in here for you to solve (but that's for another day).

### Requirements
-------------------
You need the Oracle JDK before you can start using the IDEs listed below (except for Android Studio and IntelliJ IDEA, which already comes with a JDK). You can download it from [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html). Make sure you download the correct one for your operating system.

For Linux users, go [here](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/linux_x64_install.xml) for instructions on how to install Java.

### IDEs for Java
-------------------
* [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org) is an IDE for Java and C/C++, and developed by the community. You can add plugins to it for more functionality, which can be downloaded from the Marketplace (which is included in the IDE). This is best for those who are learning Java for the first time.

* [IntelliJ IDEA](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) is an IDE developed by [JetBrains](http://www.jetbrains.com). This IDE is feature-rich, and supports many tools and frameworks. You can learn more about it at their website.

* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) is an IDE powered by the IntelliJ platform, and is dedicated for Android development. This IDE should only be used if you are developing apps for the Android platform, and is not recommended for those who are learning Java for the first time.
