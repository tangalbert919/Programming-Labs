# Python Labs
-----------------
This is the set of Python labs I have made for fun. If you want to learn Python, this is a good place to start.

Python is a flexible language can be used for many things, and will soon become the main programming language for Computer Science. Python is easy for those who want to become programmers, but experienced programmers might dislike it for its syntax.

More Python labs will be added as I continue to self-teach myself this language.

### Requirements
-----------------
For Windows and Mac users, you need to install [Python](https://www.python.org) before you can start, or the IDEs listed below will not run properly. For Linux users, it is already installed to the system, but you may need to update it if you want to use the latest version of Python (which is not a requirement).

If you're using Eclipse, the Python requirement still stands, but you need to download the [Oracle JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/index.html) to use it. Then you need to install PyDev, which is listed at the bottom of this document.

For Linux users, go [here](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/linux_x64_install.xml) for instructions on how to install Java. 

### IDEs for Python
-----------------

* [PyCharm](http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) is a powerful, feature-rich IDE developed by [JetBrains](http://jetbrains.com/). There is an open-source community edition (which is usually recommended for new Python programmers), and then there's the full-fledged professional edition for professionals. You can learn more about it at their website.

* [PyDev](http://www.pydev.org/) is a plugin for Eclipse, which can be downloaded and installed from the Eclipse marketplace (which can be accessed from the IDE itself). It's free (as always), but you need to download Eclipse from [here](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/eclipse-packages/) if you want to do that.
