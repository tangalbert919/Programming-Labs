# Python Labs
-----------------
This is the set of Python labs I have made for fun. If you want to learn Python, this is a good place to start.

Python is a flexible language can be used for many things, and will soon become the main programming language for Computer Science. Python is easy for those who want to become programmers, but experienced programmers might dislike it for its syntax.

More Python labs will be added as I continue to self-teach myself this language.

### Requirements
-----------------
For Windows and Mac users, you need to install [Python](https://www.python.org) before you can start, or the IDEs listed below will not run properly. For Linux users, it is already installed to the system, but you may need to update it if you want to use the latest version of Python.

### IDEs for Python
-----------------

* [PyCharm](http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) is a powerful, feature-rich IDE developed by [JetBrains](http://jetbrains.com/). You can learn more about it at their website.
